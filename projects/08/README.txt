Make sure VM2.py is in the same directory as the rest of the project 8 files. In terminal, enter “python3 /path/of/file/VM2.py /path/of/directory/containing/test” (Or whatever version of python is installed on your system). It’s important to run the whole directory and not just the vm file(s) inside of it.

This should generate an asm file, which can be ran on the CPU emulator together with its comparison file.

(BasicLoop, FibonacciSeries and SimpleFunction only work without the bootstrap code)
